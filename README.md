Problem Statement:

HR is currently relying on inefficient and error-prone manual processes to track and analyze employee attendance data. The existing method of using Excel spreadsheets with a date-based structure is time-consuming, prone to human error, and limits the ability to derive actionable insights. There is a critical need for a centralized, automated solution that can efficiently manage, analyze, and visualize attendance data to support data-driven decision-making within the HR department.
The objective is to develop a Power BI-based dashboard that can effectively replace the manual Excel-based attendance tracking system, providing HR with a comprehensive and interactive tool for monitoring, analyzing, and reporting on employee attendance data.

Data Cleaning and Transformation:

•	Data Import: Imported the raw data source.

•	Data Cleaning: Filtered out unnecessary rows and columns, removed duplicate data, and corrected inconsistencies.

•	Data Transformation: Reshaped the data from wide to long format using unpivoting, renamed columns for clarity, and converted data types to appropriate formats.

•	Data Quality: Identified and removed errors from the dataset.



Conclusion:

Implementing the Power BI dashboard has significantly enhanced HR's ability to manage and analyze employee attendance data efficiently. By transitioning from manual Excel-based processes to a centralized, interactive platform, the HR department has streamlined operations, reduced errors, and gained valuable insights. The dashboard empowers HR to make data-driven decisions, identify attendance trends, and optimize workforce management strategies.

Future Prospects:

The Power BI dashboard serves as a solid foundation for further HR analytics initiatives. Potential future enhancements include:

•	Advanced Analytics: Incorporating predictive modeling to forecast absenteeism rates or identify factors influencing employee attendance.

•	Integration: Integrating the dashboard with other HR systems (e.g., performance management, payroll) to provide a holistic view of employee data.

•	Mobile Accessibility: Developing a mobile-friendly version of the dashboard for on-the-go access to attendance information.

•	AI and Automation: Leveraging AI capabilities to automate routine tasks, such as anomaly detection or data cleaning, freeing up HR's time for strategic analysis.
